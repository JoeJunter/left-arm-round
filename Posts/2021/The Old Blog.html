                        <p>Last week, I rediscovered an old cricket blog of mine. It was made when I was 19 (back in the heady days of 2014), and it only had a few posts on it before it was abandoned - indeed, what is 19 for if not starting and abandoning a blog.</p>
                        <p>I was struck by it in that unique way which only our adolescent writing can. I set out reading it with a roll of my eyes and a huff, but the writing was… okay. Good, even. No, not good. But okay. At times I even found myself nodding with and agreeing with this little tyrant. But what could he know, at 19 years old? So naive, so opinionated. With each new sentence I braced myself and grimaced, but with some full stops I nodded. In the end, I found myself wishing there were more than a few entries. It was the only time I have ever read something of my own which I was not retrospectively entirely horrified by. That way in which our adolescent writing can strike us, which is usually quite cringeworthy but conflicts us with the occasional moment of total resonance was, for the first time, more resonant than horrifying.
                        </p>
                        <p>Also, say what you like about 19 year old me, but he did write a 2014 piece speculating that Joe Root was destined to be among England’s greatest ever batsmen. Was I the only one to speculate this? No. But Root at the present time of writing and at the age of 30 sits third in England’s all time Test run scorers (8714 @ 48.68) and second in England’s all time ODI run scorers (6109 @ 51.33), has a World Cup to his name and was England’s highest run scorer in the tournament.

                        <span class="caption text-muted">The profile picture of the Old Blog - A joint Man of the Match picture at Stiffkey Cricket Club. My Dad, after a typically brutalist innings of around 40 (if I remember correctly), and Me, after four wickets (Yes, yes I do remember). As I just finished writing this, I realised I am wearing that Durham top now. The sponsor has worn, but the sun of the now rebranded Durham Dynamos still burns bright.</span>

                        <p>The Old Blog, by the old me. The boy who was sure James Taylor was destined for a 50+ test average over 100+ matches. Who felt sure he knew the future after looking over the numbers. Who would go on to struggle greatly with his studies as university went on because, above all, he didn’t know who he was yet.</p>
                        <p>In a way like no other, reading his writing on the game has reminded me who he was to the most minute detail. Of course, he knew nothing. It would be easy to belittle him, as if I know more. But perhaps I can learn from him. His certainties, his optimism and his naivety all together. He was so enthusiastic, he wanted to share his thoughts on the game he loved so much with those around him. And if nobody read it, at the very least he shared it with himself, past, present and future. I am humbled by him.</p>

                        <p>Let’s celebrate him. Let’s look at the numbers, look at the footwork, the glovework, the wrist position, and let’s boldly predict what they might achieve. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Above all, safe in no knowledge what might happen in the future, let’s watch the cricket.
                        </p>
